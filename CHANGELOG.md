## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Canonical OMP NInfer product repository and naming.
- Draft `v0.1.0-beta.1` manifest binding OMP, NInfer, Qwen3.8, the RTX 5090 profile,
  qualification evidence, Homebrew, and publication blockers.
- Invited-tester quickstart for OMP on Apple-silicon macOS connected through an authenticated SSH
  local forward to NInfer on a Linux or WSL2 RTX 5090 host.
- Digest- and hash-verifying NInfer launcher, owned-container stop path, OMP provider fragment, and
  fail-closed OMP overlay.
- Runtime qualification summary covering exact long context, serving protocols, Vision, stateful
  Responses, cache reuse, Golden behavior, measured decode throughput, and explicit lifecycle
  non-claims.
- Architecture, security, release, troubleshooting, related-work, roadmap, contribution, and support
  documentation.
- Hardware-report and installation-failure issue forms.
- Standard-library release-contract verifier and CI checks, including a truthful
  `draft` → installable `candidate` → externally accepted `ready` transition.
- OMP NInfer brand system with source SVG/HTML, rendered README and architecture artwork, social
  preview, lockups, and icon/favicon variants.
- Deterministic local RTX 5090 binary package, OCI archive, and SPDX SBOM identities, plus a
  state-faithful remote lifecycle rehearsal; publication remains a separate gate.
- Fresh RTX 4090 package/install/restart evidence with an explicit Golden typed-tool-call blocker;
  no RTX 4090 support claim was added.

### Security

- Restricted both NInfer and tunnel listeners to loopback in the supported profile.
- Required a user-only NInfer bearer-key file and disabled OMP model fallback for beta acceptance.
- Required immutable model, binary, image, SBOM, OMP artifact, qualification-summary, and Homebrew
  identities before a release can move from `draft` to `ready`.
- Excluded secrets, private host identifiers, prompts, model output, and raw logs from support
  material.
